# Visualization-of-data-mining-in-Crime-dataset

In this project, we focus on the distribution of crimes in Allegheny County over a period of five years ranging from 2013 to 2017, and visualize the intensity of crimes based on year and crime type, we also did analysis on the distribution of crimes across different quarters and month. Classification of the crimes is based on the severity of the crime type, ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/19311536/145498303-7e40476d-823b-4a1b-ad00-e94b6f99e9ad.png)
